Now, I’ll introduce the **Implementation** of the core **algorithm** of search.
We try to break through the most important **issue** in the search field ——the speed.  
In the preview, we set **Elasticsearch** into the **commercial** project of cloud service. 
Actually, we need to consider **scalability** and application. 
**Combined** with the usage, we not only created the **original** search **algorithm** 
but also improved **ElasticSearch** to make it more suitable for our needs. 
While **reminding** the JSON format, we also **redesigned** the reverse index **algorithm**. 
We realize behind the simple statements, the designer’s **wisdom** is **embodied**. 
In terms of the **reverse** index, As you can see, there are two tables,
One is the keywords, the other takes down the weight of the keywords 
and their relationship with documents. 
We only need to find the field **corresponding** to each ID.
It can index to our target document, and at the same time add the weight.
These tables **exist** in the form of  CPP Class.
In addition, we also tried B-Tree, red balck tree , and **binary** search algorithm. 
Next，It's Yunfei's Time
