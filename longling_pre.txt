1	Introduction
Hello, we are group 8, and our option is option3. 
Our project is to design a searching engine. In the 21st century, 
there is huge amount of data created. We, the creator of data, also need to use data created by other people. 
Just like to find a book from a large library, almost everyone needs to find the information 
they need in large amount of information. But how to find? There are already numerous existing searching tools nowadays. 
For example, when we need to find a specific syntax, we simply type “How to create a class in C++” 
in the google search engine and then there will be thousands of related information in the webpage. 
But in our design, we integrate what we have learned so far and our creativity to build a searching engine 
specially use for our study, for you, for me, for all the student in PolyU.  By using our searching engine, 
you can find the course you want in the fastest way.
2	Usage 
First let me introduce how to use this program. It is very convenient, just like you search on Google. 
You just need to type keywords, for example “COMP1011” and our program will automatically find 
all subjects related to “comp1011” to you. Then, you can choose to view the details and download 
the subject description form in PDF format. Meanwhile, you can know the relation index of subjects, 
which show you how relative to your keywords, and help you find the one you want as much as possible.
