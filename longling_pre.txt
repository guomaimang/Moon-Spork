1	Introduction
Hello, we are group 8. I'm Longling.
Our project is to design a searching engine. In the 21st century, 
there is huge amount of data created and almost everyone needs to find the information in this huge amount of data.
But how to find? There are already numerous existing searching tools nowadays. 
For example,the google search engine. But in our design, we integrate what we have learned so far and inspire our creativity 
to build a searching engine pecially use for our study, you can find the course you want in the fastest way.
All students in PolyU, like you and me will find this searching tool so useful for your study.

2	Usage 
First let me introduce how to use this program. It is very convenient, just like how you search on Google. 
You just need to type some keywords, for example “COMP1011” and our program will automatically find 
all subjects related to “comp1011” to you. Then, you can choose to view the details and download 
the detailed description in PDF format. Another point I want to mention that, our design is more advanced than others
because you can also find the relation index, which shows how the subject relative to your keywords.
This will help you find the subject you want to find as much as possible.
