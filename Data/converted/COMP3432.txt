Teaching/Learning  During the lectures, students will be taught the basic principles of 
Methodology  innovative computing paradigms. Whenever possible, to reinforce 
students understanding of the concepts taught, practical examples 
and study will be introduced. 
 
During tutorial, students will be required to solve problems and 
questions pertaining to various computing paradigms that promote 
human centric interaction and computation. Lab sessions will be 
setup to teach students to use software and tools related to materials 
taught in the class. 
 
In addition to quizzes and individual assignments to train students 
on their independent problem solving skills, group projects will be 
set to allow students to work in as a group.
